A graph is formed by two sets. The first, finite and non-empty, consists of vertices. The second one consists of edges or arcs, which can connect two vertices. We call networks entities from natural or social phenomena that hold some relationship. Networks are represented mathematically by graphs. Imagine a network of healthcare professionals. Doctors and nurses are examples of possible vertices of this network. The connections between them can represent the occurrence of daily interaction. Thus, if two professionals do not interact daily, an edge or arc between the two vertices that represent them is absent. Conversely, if they do so, such edge or arc is present.
